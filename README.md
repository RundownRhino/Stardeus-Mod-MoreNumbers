# MoreNumbers
...is a mod with the goal of exposing more of the game's details in tooltips and other sources. And, I guess, various other QoL improvements.
## Current features
- tooltip for "planetary flight" in navigation menu shows the speed calculation
- the "energy output" section on fuels shows a conversion to kWh instead of just the internal units
- descriptions for all buildings that act as a battery have a section with their battery capacity, output, and time-to-discharge.
- crafters will no longer send any "missing materials" notifications for unlimited orders
- Hovering over a region in universe map will list all autodrills in that region (much like how hovering over a sector in region view does).
